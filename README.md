# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build an HTML page that allows up to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page.  The filters are needed because there are several different sightings that occured all throughout the United States and different types of sightings.

## Results
When entering the site, our clients will be able to see the basic opening with a title and picture at the top in the page header, an article title on the left, and an article paragraph on the right as seen below.

As our client scrolls down the page they will be able to see the data and filters that we have with 5 different filters to choose from (date, city, state, country, and shape).  You can enter in any of these filters in the search bar and the HTML page will show the sightings for that specific search.  Multiple filters can be selected at the sasme time to narrow the search.  Below is an image of the filters at the bottom of the page.

##Summary
We have created a page that is simple, clean, and allows users to search and filter through the sitings within our dataset using the search bars created.  A drawback of this page is the limitation of the dataset.  The dataset only takes place over the course of two weeks and only takes place throughout different parts of the United States, yet there is a search for date and country indicating to the user the the dataset is more broad than it is.  

A recommendation would be to indicate the narrow scope of the data set or to webscrape other existing datasets from other pages and incorporate it into this one so that that the amount of data to search from could be  more extensive and give more credibility to belief that UFOs do exist and that the sightings are not isolated.
