# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build an HTML page that allows up to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page.  The filters are needed because there are several different sightings that occured all throughout the United States and different types of sightings.

## Results
When entering the site, our clients will be able to see the basic opening with a title and picture at the top in the page header, an article title on the left, and an article paragraph on the right.
