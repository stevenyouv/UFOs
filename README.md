# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build an HTML page that allows up to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page.  The filters are needed because there are several different sightings that occured all throughout the United States and different types of sightings.

## Results
When entering the site, our clients will be able to see the basic opening with a title and picture at the top in the page header, an article title on the left, and an article paragraph on the right as seen below.



As our client scrolls down the page they will be able to see the data and filters that we have with 5 different filters to choose from (date, city, state, country, and shape).  You can enter in any of these filters in the search bar and the HTML page will show the sightings for that specific search.  Multiple filters can be selected at the sasme time to narrow the search.  Below is an image of the filters at the bottom of the page.
